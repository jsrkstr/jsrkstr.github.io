	<p>To keep things simple - I create websites. If web apps are your thing then sure - I am pretty good at that too! <br /><em>What I really do is design experiences for your customers so they can go ahead making the decision you'll love.</em></p>

	<p>If you are curious, I suggest taking a moment out to browse through some of my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/work">past work.</a></p>

	<p>Some things that consume my time for a good measure : </p>

	<ul>
		<li>beautiful design</li>
		<li>writing markup that doesn't look like gospel</li>
		<li>improving web apps</li>
		<li>I am online if ( !sleeping )</li>
		<li>eating if ( !online &amp;&amp; !sleeping )</li>
		<li>working out if ( !eating &amp;&amp; !online &amp;&amp; !sleeping )<strong></strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>&nbsp;I<br>
	</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><em>make</em> web a better place</li>
	<li><em><s>do</s> used to do</em> lots of WordPress stuff</li>
	<li><em>develop</em> platform agnostic experiences</li>
	<li><em>believe</em> <s>code</s> markup is Poetry</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I strongly encourage you to work with me. I am one of those rare bread of design unicorns who code their own designs. <br />It's best to <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">email me</a>. I am usually prompt in replying back. </p>

	<p class="laziness">*This is a <em>living document</em>. The above stuff may change when author feels compelled due to internal or external forces. He must ward off laziness to make modifications required with time or due to change of interests. For you, it means – keep revisiting. One day, you’ll find what you’re looking for :) </p>
