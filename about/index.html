	<p>To keep things simple - I create websites. If mobile or web apps are your thing then sure - I am pretty good at that too! <br /><em>What I really do is design experiences for your customers so they can go ahead making the decision you'll love.</em></p>

	<p>If you are curious, I suggest taking a moment out to browse through some of my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/work">past work.</a></p>
