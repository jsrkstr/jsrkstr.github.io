<h3>OneYear@AdoMado</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p>It was 2010′s summer break from the college and i had two full months to enjoy. That&nbsp;month i attended the Startup Saturday meetup where entrepreneurs and techies came and discussed about their ventures or startups. Startups are small companies focused on innovative ideas, carried a vision to do something great and to reach from ground to the sky.  </p>

<p>A few months later i met Mayank Jain, a MAIT alumni, at a seminar in my college. He introduced himself as a co-founder of a startup called <a href="http://adomado.com/about" title="AdoMado.com">AdoMado.com</a>. They were into web advertising business. We discussed about the new languages i had learned and the racing game i had developed using Javascript. I found out that they were actually looking for interns for their startup and had asked us to mail our resume. The following week i had telephonic interview with the two co-founders and in a few days they had asked me to come over to their office (which i discovered to be a home cum office). Mayank sir told me that he was impressed with my game and that i had learnt many things that were not taught at any institute and you had to learn them on your own. And this journey started with his words “Welcome Onboard”.</p>

<p>Soon i had two week break from college for the Common Wealth games. This turned out to be a great opportunity for me to be there at office for full day and learn as much as possible. My first day at office. It was just a small room with just one desktop and everyone was sitting on bean bags with their laptops. Talking about the culture of a startup, it’s really cool. You dressup the way you like, sit any where you like, on the couch, the beanbag or the chair. Solve complex programming problems while you listen to your favourite&nbsp;music. The idea is to enjoy what you do because we believe that best results are produced only when you enjoy the journey.</p>

<p>I also took a bean bag. Soon my boss briefed me on my first project, which was to build an SMS application that could send sms. The next project was to write a plugin for Google Chrome that could show a toolbar on the page. Actually there are no toolbars supported in chrome so i was very excited to develop the first ever toolbar for it. I was given a week to do the research. I was responsible for everything about this project, from research to development and maintainence and even testing. This approach really works as it’s your own ass on stake. You write the bad code then you gotta fix more bugs.</p>

<p>One of the best things in startup is that you are involved in almost everything around you. We are not only aware of the technology you work with, but also you get to know what others are doing. We are encouraged to share our thoughts with others by giving presentations and having discussions.

<p>By the end of 2010, we had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar" title="Toolbar">browser toolbar</a> for popular web browsers and an <a href="http://adomado.com/appstore" title="AppStore">AppStore</a> with hundreds of apps. But soon we had realized that the world had moved on from toolbars. Toolbars were no more a cool thing to have as it occupied a permanent space on your screen. Moreover the apps were not so cool to use. Hence we called them “Dumb Apps”.</p>

<p>One afternoon we were brainstorming to find new ways to reinvent our platform and present those app to the users. Then Sameer sir had clicked on a great idea of having a box on the webpage that holds up all your apps. The idea is now realized by the awesome <a href="http://appdok.com" title="AppDok">Appdok</a>. Appdok was to become the new face of AdoMado. But a box with just icons of “dumb apps” &nbsp;would have been a dumb idea itself, so we also discussed about new apps which could interact with users and could be a lot useful and cool to use. Later these apps were called the “Intelligent Apps”.</p>

<p>After all that discussion, now was the time to make it really happen. We decided upon one month’s deadline to have an Appdok with atleast ten intelligent apps to save our world. Beside appdok, &nbsp;a platform for apps was to be designed and whole idea was also to be launched in the same month. We were so exited that never had a thought about amount of work that would be required.</p>

<p>Everything was to be done by a team of two, me and Mayank sir.&nbsp;That month we worked like crazies, making the shift from 10am to 7pm &nbsp;and monday to saturday. That was about 9 hrs a day plus 2 hrs of travelling for me. Such is the time when you realize the importance of weekends. On weekends you which to do everything you missed the whole week.</p>

<p>We made the prototype in no time and were now finishing two apps a day to keep up in the race against the time. Finally, in august we launched the Appdok. &nbsp;We got good feedback. Appdok and Intelligent apps had opened a new dimension for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/AdoMadoEngineering" title="AdoMado Engineering">AdoMado Engineering</a>. Endless possibilities could now be seen and the world of web applications was open to us.</p>

<p>It is only now that i realized that i had worked in a very fast paced, time bound and challenging environment. And i take great pride in having experienced the change where i had tested my abilities and dedication.</p>

<p>Working at startup is about making amazing and innovative things that make you feel satisfied with the hardwork you did the whole day. An amazing feeling fills you up as make way to your home. A sense of accomplishment prepares you for the hurdle of tomorrow.</p>

<p>I am very much thankful to Mayank sir to have realized my potential. I think it was the game i had made in which they saw the artist in me and gave me a chance to work with them.</p>

<p>This One year@AdoModo has been the a great experience of my life. I look forward to continue this journey with more responsibility and passion.</p>
